                i'll probably add new projects later, when i finally decide to save them on github<br>

            <p class="abp">i'm still learning how to code, and i don't really like messing with css (yes, that's my excuse if this site is ugly, sorry).
                        <br>other than that, i enjoy making sites work with databases, and i'll probably end up studying more back-end stuff than front-end, although i think i will study that too.
                        <br>some other things about me is that i enjoy watching anime and playing games.
                        <br>that's about it, thanks for stopping by! </p>
